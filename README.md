# Bevy Voxel Server
Eventually, this plugin aims to be a complete solution for a voxel server for clients to connect to (with their own custom voxel renderers). For now, it aims to only implement a chunked voxel world, with a visualizer to see what chunks are loaded, and manipulate voxels with text commands.
